/**
 * Helps the creation of partial mocks with {@link EasyMock}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example of usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyClass {
 *     public MyClass(A a, B b) {
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * public class MyClassTest {
 *     &#064;Test
 *     public void testFoo() throws Exception {
 *         IMocksControl mockControl = createControl();
 *         A a = mockControl.createMock(A.class);
 *         B b = mockControl.createMock(B.class);
 *
 *         MyClass myClass = createMockBuilder(MyClass.class)
 *                 .withConstructor(a, b).createMock(mockControl);
 *
 *         // Set the expectations of A and B and test some method in MyClass
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class also has support for partial mocks as shown by the example below:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyMockedClass {
 *     // Empty class is also valid for {@link IMockBuilder}.
 *     public MyMockedClass() {
 *     }
 *
 *     public void foo(int a) {
 *         blah(a);
 *         bleh();
 *     }
 *
 *     public void blah(int a) {
 *     }
 *
 *     public void bleh() {
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * public class MyMockedClassTest {
 *     &#064;Test
 *     public void testFoo() throws Exception {
 *         MyMockedClass myMockedClass = createMockBuilder(MyMockedClass.class)
 *                 .withConstructor().addMockedMethod(&quot;blah&quot;, int.class)
 *                 .addMockedMethod(&quot;bleh&quot;).createMock();
 *
 *         // These are the expectations.
 *         myMockedClass.blah(1);
 *         myMockedClass.bleh();
 *         replay(myMockedClass);
 *
 *         myMockedClass.foo(1);
 *         verify(myMockedClass);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Warning: There may be ambiguities when there are two different constructors
 * with compatible types. For instance:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class A {
 * }
 *
 * public class B extends A {
 * }
 *
 * public class ClassWithAmbiguity {
 *     public ClassWithAmbiguity(A a) {
 *     }
 *
 *     public ClassWithAmbiguity(B b) {
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * will cause problems if using {@link #withConstructor(Object...)}. To solve
 * this, you can explicitly define the constructor parameter types to use by
 * calling {@link #withConstructor(Class...)} and then
 * {@link #withArgs(Object...)}, like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * createMockBuilder(MyMockedClass.class).withConstructor(A.class).withArgs(
 *         new A()).createMock();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            type of the object being created
