                      <p>We just started to use EasyMock in an XP project and found that it eases writing our TestCases considerably. Moreover, it encourages us to make more frequent use of MockObjects leading to compositional and interface oriented designs. Not only is it well crafted and easy to use. It also enhances communication in the TestCase for it exposes the expected calls on the MockObject right where you need it.</p>

                      <p>I have been using EasyMock to unit test some web-based classes without requiring the presence of the app server and I am very impressed. It is extremely easy to use and makes writing the unit tests a breeze - great job!</p>
