# Ruby version

Use `rbenv` to select the right ruby version.

Look at [https://pages.github.com/versions/] to see which version `github-pages` is currently using and set it in `.ruby-version`.

# Local installation

```shell
rbenv install
bundle install
```
# Run

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
