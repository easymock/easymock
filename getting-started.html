<div class="container">
  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>Add EasyMock dependency to your POM file.</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.easymock</groupId>
  <artifactId>easymock</artifactId>
  <version>{{site.latest_version}}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Then, you need a class to test and a collaborator used by this class. The collaborator can be a class or an interface. It doesn't matter. Please don't create an interface just for the pleasure of mocking it.</p>

{% highlight java %}
public interface Collaborator {
    void documentAdded(String title);
}

public class ClassUnderTest {

    private Collaborator listener;
    // ...
    public void setListener(Collaborator listener) {
        this.listener = listener;
    }
    public void addDocument(String title, byte[] document) { 
        // ... 
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>In our case, we are expecting the collaborator to be notified when a document is added to the class under test. So lets do that. First our todo list:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Create the mock</li>
        <li>Have it set to the tested class</li>
        <li>Record what we expect the mock to do</li>
        <li>Tell all mocks we are now doing the actual testing</li>
        <li>Test</li>
        <li>Make sure everything that was supposed to be called was called</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Then the code fulfilling it:</p>

{% highlight java %}
import static org.easymock.EasyMock.*;
import org.easymock.*;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;

public class ExampleTest extends EasyMockSupport {

    @Rule
    public EasyMockRule rule = new EasyMockRule(this);

    @Mock
    private Collaborator collaborator; // 1

    @TestSubject
    private final ClassTested classUnderTest = new ClassTested(); // 2

    @Test
    public void addDocument() {
        collaborator.documentAdded("New Document"); // 3
        replayAll(); // 4
        classUnderTest.addDocument("New Document", "content"); // 5
        verifyAll(); // 6
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>And that's all you need to get you started. Some comments though:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extending (or delegating to) `EasyMockSupport` is useful but not mandatory</li>
        <li>Mock injection is done on fields so you won't need a setter only used for testing</li>
        <li>We are testing here that `documentAdded` will be called once and only once using this exact parameter.
        That's what we expect. Any other result means that the collaborator is notified too many time (or not at all)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From there, I will highly suggest you have a look at the
        <a href="https://github.com/easymock/easymock/tree/master/core/src/samples/java/org/easymock/samples">samples</a>
        and the <a href="user-guide.html">full documentation</a> to get a fair overview of EasyMock.
    </p>

        <p>Happy mocking!</p>
    </div>
